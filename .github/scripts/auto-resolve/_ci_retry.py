"""The one exponential-backoff retry loop for a CI command, in Python.

PROBLEM CLASS — a flaky CI command (a ``gh`` call against a 5xx-ing API, a
network read) must be re-run with exponential backoff, under one spelling of the
``RETRY_MAX`` and ``RETRY_BASE_DELAY`` knobs and one wording of the two
``ci-retry:`` log lines a human greps the job log for. ``lib-ci-retry.sh`` is the
bash side of the same contract; import this instead of writing the loop again.

The caller keeps what genuinely differs between call sites: how one attempt runs
and what an exhausted retry means — an empty answer, or a raise. Both arguments.

Standard library only: the discover job checks out ``.github/scripts`` sparsely
and runs on the system ``python3``, with no virtual environment.
