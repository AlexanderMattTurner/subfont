# Keep the `merge-conflict` label on every open PR whose GitHub-computed
# mergeability is CONFLICTING, and clear it once the PR merges cleanly again.
# Conflict cost scales with how long a branch sits behind a fast-moving base,
# so surfacing the transition the moment it happens (instead of at merge time,
# hundreds of commits later) is what keeps resolutions small enough to review
# honestly. Event-driven with a cron backstop; API-only — it never pushes to a
# PR branch and never triggers a CI run on one.
#
# Scope: with PR_NUMBER set (a PR event) it syncs that one PR; unset (a base
# push / schedule) it scans every open PR. A single-PR sync is what clears the
# label seconds after a conflict is resolved.
#
# GitHub computes mergeability lazily: querying a PR triggers the computation,
# so a PR reporting UNKNOWN on the first pass usually resolves by a later one.
# PRs still UNKNOWN after MAX_PASSES are named in a workflow warning — never
# silently skipped — and the next event or scheduled run retries them anyway.
# Env: GH_TOKEN, REPO; PR_NUMBER scopes to one PR; MAX_PASSES (default 2) caps
# the retry loop; RETRY_DELAY_SECS overrides the between-pass wait; SWEEP_LIMIT
# (default 100) caps how many open PRs one full-repo sweep lists.
