# Sourcing this defines the variables below. It reads the JSON at source time, so
# a malformed file fails the caller immediately rather than leaving every name an
# empty string — an empty label name would make `gh pr edit --add-label ""` fail
# obscurely, and an empty status context would silently match nothing.

# Sourced by more than one lib in the same process (each names its dependency
# explicitly rather than relying on a sibling having sourced it first), so make a
# repeat source free instead of re-running four jq processes.
